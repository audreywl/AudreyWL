							<h1>AVPM Technical Design</h1>

							<p>The Franklin W Olin Players produced <em>A Very Potter Musical</em> in the fall of 2017, our first musical in many years. Many things about our decision to do the show were a gamble -  would we have enough actors, techs, and musicians interested? Would the amateur student directorial team get the show up and running in time? And my particular issue as technical director - would we be able to successfully convert an area of our theater-less campus into a performing arts space? </p>

							<p>There was only one space on campus large enough to seat the audience we hoped to draw for the musical: Olin's singular lecture hall/auditorium. FWOP had eschewed the hall in earlier years becuase the stage area wasn't large enough for much moving around or dance numbers. To compensate, for this show we designed a scheme where raised platforms would be built over the first two rows of seats, extending our reach considerably. This plan needed to be approved by campus facilities, so I mocked up the design in Solidworks and submitted a packet of drawing plans in advance of our build. Unfortunately, the raised platform wasn't approved in the end, and we had to contend with a shorter stage on ground level. </p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/avpm/foam.jpg"></img><br><img src="images/avpm/bench.jpg"></img></span>The space also presented several other unique challenges. Because of our decreased stage depth, we had to prioritize a skinny backdrop, and we couldn't be intrusive in our modifications to the space. To easily build a skinny, light, self-supporting backdrop, we chose foam, a somewhat unconvential material.

								<p>Early in the build process, we experimented with the material, and learned how to texture it with heat. We used these techniques on the backdrop and also on a "stone" arch that we moved for different scenes to create different spaces.
							</p>

							<span class="image right"></span>
							<p>We also prioritized reusability for our set pieces. We designed and built 6 sturdy, all-purpose benches.
							</p><p>
								For the rest of the props, we leaned into the haphazard, improvised aesthetic of the musical and made them out of 3-ply cardboard. We printed the outlines on a poster printer, attached them to the cardboard with spray adhesive, cut them each out with a scroll saw and handpainted each one. These props included everything from a giant sandwich to a Hungarian Horntail dragon operated by 5 techs.

						 <p>In the end, I'm proud of how our team both incorporated and overcame the quirks of our space to make the largest musical Olin has ever seen.</p>
